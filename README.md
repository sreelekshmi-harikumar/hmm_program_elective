Website workflow:-
1. Enter your observation sequence

Type a space-separated list of numbers into the input box. These are your observed symbols — for example 0 1 2 0 1 2 1 0. Each number represents a different observation type.  

3. Set your parameters

Hidden states — how many hidden states you want the model to learn (start with 2)  

Symbols (M) — how many distinct values are in your sequence  

Max iterations — how many training steps to allow (100 is fine)  

Seed — controls the random starting point; try different seeds if results look odd

3. Click "Run Baum-Welch Algorithm"

The model trains and all results appear automatically.
